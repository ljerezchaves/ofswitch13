Overview
========

The OpenFlow 1.3 module for |ns3|, also known as the |ofs13| module, was
designed to enhance the `ns-3 Network Simulator <http://www.nsnam.org>`_ with
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology support. Despite the fact that the
|ns3| already has a module that supports simulations with OpenFlow switches, it
is possible to note that the available implementation provides a very outdated
OpenFlow protocol (version 0.8.9, from 2008). Many new major features were
introduced up to the latest version, and we want to have them available for
use.

The |ofs13| module provides support for OpenFlow protocol version 1.3, bringing
both a switch device and a controller application interface to the |ns3|
simulator, as depicted in Figure :ref:`fig-ofswitch13-module`, from
[Chaves2016]_. With this module, it is possible to interconnect |ns3| nodes to
send and receive traffic using the existing ``CsmaNetDevice`` or
``VirtualNetDevice``. The controller application interface can be extended to
implement any desired control logic to orchestrate the network. The
communication between the controller and the switch is realized over standard
|ns3| protocol stack, devices, and channels. The module also relies on the
external `OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch for ns-3
<https://github.com/ljerezchaves/ofsoftswitch13>`_ compiled as a library,
namely the |ofslib| library. This library provides the switch datapath
implementation, the code for converting OpenFlow messages to and from wire
format, and the ``dpctl`` utility tool for configuring the switch from the
command line. The source code for the |ofs13| module lives in the directory
``src/ofswitch13``.

OpenFlow 1.3 Switch Device
##########################

The OpenFlow 1.3 switch device, namely ``OFSwitch13Device``, can be used to
interconnect |ns3| nodes using the existing network devices and channels.
Figure :ref:`fig-ofswitch13-netdevice` shows the internal switch device
structure. It takes a collection of ``OFSwitch13Port`` acting as input/output
ports, each one associated with an |ns3| underlying ``NetDevice``. In most
cases, the ``CsmaNetDevice`` is used to build the ports, which will act as
physical ports. However, it is possible to use a ``VirtualNetDevice`` to
implement logical ports. The switch device acts as the intermediary between the
ports, receiving a packet from one port and forwarding it to another. The
|ofslib| library provides the OpenFlow switch datapath implementation (flow
tables, group table, and meter table). For this reason, packets entering the
switch are sent to the library for OpenFlow pipeline processing before being
forwarded to the correct output port(s). OpenFlow messages received from the
controller are also sent to the library for datapath configuration.

.. _fig-ofswitch13-netdevice:

.. figure:: figures/ofswitch13-switch.*
   :align: center

   The ``OFSwitch13Device`` internal structure

A packet enters the switch device through the new OpenFlow receive callback in
the ``NetDevice``, which is invoked for packets successfully received by the
device. This callback is a promiscuous one, but in contrast to a promiscuous
protocol handler, the packet sent to this callback includes all the headers,
which are necessary during OpenFlow pipeline processing. Including this new
callback in the ``NetDevice`` is the only required modification to the |ns3|
source code for |ofs13| usage.

The incoming packet is checked for conformance to the CPU processing capacity
(throughput) defined by the ``OFSwitch13Device::CpuCapacity`` attribute.
Packets exceeding CPU processing capacity are dropped, while conformant packets
are sent to the pipeline at the |ofslib| library.

The module considers the concept of *virtual TCAM* (Ternary Content-Addressable
Memory) to estimate the average flow table search time to model OpenFlow
hardware operations. It considers that real OpenFlow implementations use
sophisticated search algorithms for packet matching such as hierarchical hash
tables or binary search trees. Because of that, the following equation is used
to estimate the delay:

.. math::
  K * log_2 (n)

where *K* is the ``OFSwitch13Device::TcamDelay`` attribute set to the time for
a single TCAM operation, and *n* is the current number of entries on pipeline
flow tables.

Packets coming back from the library for output action are sent to the OpenFlow
queue provided by the module. An OpenFlow switch provides limited QoS support
employing a simple queuing mechanism, where each port can have one or more
queues attached to it. Packets sent to a specific queue are treated according
to that queue's configuration. Queue configuration takes place outside the
OpenFlow protocol. The ``OFSwitch13Queue`` abstract base class implements the
queue interface, extending the |ns3| ``Queue<Packet>`` class to allow
compatibility with the ``CsmaNetDevice`` used within ``OFSwitch13Port`` objects
(``VirtualNetDevice`` does not use queues). In this way, it is possible to
replace the standard ``CsmaNetDevice::TxQueue`` attribute by this modified
``OFSwitch13Queue`` object. Internally, it can hold a collection of N (possibly
different) queues, each one identified by a unique ID ranging from 0 to N-1.
Packets sent to the OpenFlow queue for transmission by the ``CsmaNetDevice``
are expected to carry the ``QueueTag``, which is used by the
``OFSwitch13Queue::Enqueue`` method to identify the internal queue that will
hold the packet. Specialized ``OFSwitch13Queue`` subclasses can perform
different output scheduling algorithms by implementing the ``Peek``,
``Dequeue``, and ``Remove`` pure virtual methods from |ns3| ``Queue``. The last
two methods must call the ``NotifyDequeue`` and ``NotifyRemoved`` methods
respectively, which are used by the ``OFSwitch13Queue`` to keep consistent
statistics.

The OpenFlow port type queue can be configured by the
``OFSwitch13Port::QueueFactory`` attribute at construction time. Currently, the
``OFSwitch13PriorityQueue`` is the only specialized OpenFlow queue available
for use. It implements the priority queuing discipline for a collection of N
priority queues, identified by IDs ranging from 0 to N-1 with decreasing
priority (queue ID 0 has the highest priority). The output scheduling algorithm
ensures that higher-priority queues are always served first. The
``OFSwitch13PriorityQueue::QueueFactory`` and
``OFSwitch13PriorityQueue::NumQueues`` attributes can be used to configure the
type and the number of internal priority queues, respectively. By default, it
creates a single ``DropTailQueue`` operating in packet mode with the maximum
number of packets set to 100.

OpenFlow 1.3 Controller Application Interface
#############################################

The OpenFlow 1.3 controller application interface, namely
``OFSwitch13Controller``, provides the necessary functionalities for controller
implementation. It can handle a collection of OpenFlow switches, as illustrated
in Figure :ref:`fig-ofswitch13-controller`. For constructing OpenFlow
configuration messages and sending them to the switches, the controller
interface relies on the ``dpctl`` utility provided by the |ofslib| library.
With a simple command-line syntax, this utility can be used to add flows to
the pipeline, query for switch features and status, and change other
configurations.

.. _fig-ofswitch13-controller:

.. figure:: figures/ofswitch13-controller.*
  :align: center

  The ``OFSwitch13Controller`` internal structure

For OpenFlow messages coming from the switches, the controller interface
provides a collection of internal handlers to deal with the different types of
messages. Some handlers cannot be modified by derived class, as they must
behave as already implemented. Other handlers can be overridden to implement
the desired control logic.

The |ofs13| module brings the ``OFSwitch13LearningController`` class that
implements the controller interface to work as a "learning bridge controller"
(see 802.1D). This learning controller instructs the OpenFlow switches to
forward incoming unicast frames from one port to the single correct output port
whenever possible (similar to the ``ns3::BridgeNetDevice``).

OpenFlow channel
################

The OpenFlow channel is the interface that connects switches to OpenFlow
controllers. Through this interface, the controller configures and manages the
switch. In the |ofs13| module, the controller interface can manage the switch
devices remotely over a separate dedicated network (out-of-band controller
connection). It is possible to use standard |ns3| protocol stack, channels and
devices to create the OpenFlow channel connections using a single shared
channel or individual links between the controller interface and each switch
device. This model provides realistic control plane connections, including
communication delay and, optionally, error models. It also simplifies the
OpenFlow protocol analysis, as the |ns3| tracing subsystem can be used for
outputting PCAP files.

Considering that the OpenFlow messages traversing the OpenFlow channel follow
the standard wire format, it is also possible to use the |ns3| ``TapBridge``
module to integrate an external OpenFlow controller, running on the local
machine, to the simulated environment.

Library integration
###################

This module was designed to work together with a user-space software switch
implementation. The original `Basic OpenFlow User Space Software Switch
(BOFUSS) project <https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13>`_ (also known as
|ofslib|) [Fernandes2019]_ was forked and slightly modified, resulting in the
`OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch for ns-3
<https://github.com/ljerezchaves/ofsoftswitch13>`_ library. The ``ns3lib``
branch includes some callbacks, compiler directives and minor changes in
structure declarations to allow the integration between the module and the
|ns3|. The code does not modify the original switch datapath implementation,
which is currently maintained in the original repository and regularly synced
to the modified one.

Figure :ref:`fig-ofswitch13-library`, adapted from [Fernandes2014]_, shows the
library architecture and highlights the |ns3| integration points. The library
provides the complete OpenFlow switch datapath implementation, including input
and output ports, the flow-table pipeline for packet matching, the group table,
and the meter table. It also provides the ``OFLib`` library for converting
internal messages to and from OpenFlow 1.3 wire format and the ``dpctl``
utility for converting text commands into internal messages. The *NetBee*
library was used for packet decoding and parsing up to |ofs13| version 3.3.0,
based on the *NetPDL* XML-based language for packet description [Risso2006]_.
The *NetBee* dependence was removed in |ofs13| version 4.0.0.

.. _fig-ofswitch13-library:

.. figure:: figures/ofswitch13-library.*
   :align: center

   |ns3| integration to the OpenFlow 1.3 software switch architecture

For proper |ns3| integration, the switch ports were set aside, and the library
was modified to receive and send packets directly to the |ns3| environment. To
this, all library functions related to sending and receiving packets over ports
were annotated as *weak symbols*, allowing the module to override them at link
time. This same strategy was used for overriding time-related functions,
ensuring time consistency between the library and the simulator. The
integration also relies on callbacks, which are used by the library to notify
the module about internal packet events, like packets dropped by meter bands,
packet content modifications by pipeline instructions, packets cloned by group
actions, and buffered packets sent to the controller. As this integration
involves callbacks and overridden functions, the module uses a global map to
save pointers to all ``OFSwitch13Devices`` objects in the simulation, allowing
faster object retrieve by datapath IP.

One potential performance drawback is the conversion between the |ns3| packet
representation and the serialized packet buffer used by the library. This
problem is even more critical for empty packets, as |ns3| provides optimized
internal representation for them. To improve the performance, when a packet is
sent to the library for pipeline processing, the module keeps track of its
original |ns3| packet using the ``PipelinePacket`` structure. For packets
processed by the pipeline without content changes, the switch device forwards
the original |ns3| packet to the specified output port. In the face of content
changes, the switch device creates a new |ns3| packet with the modified content
(discarding the original packet, eventually copying all packet and byte tags to
the new one). This approach is more expensive than the previous one but is far
more simple than identifying which changes were made to the packet by the
library. *Note that the byte tags in the new packet will cover the entire
packet, regardless of the byte range in the original packet.*

Scope and Limitations
=====================

This module is intended for simulating OpenFlow networks, considering the main
features available in OpenFlow version 1.3. The module provides a complete
OpenFlow switch device and the OpenFlow controller interface. The switch is
fully functional, while the controller interface is intended to allow users
to write more sophisticated controllers to exploit the real benefits offered by
SDN paradigm. However, some features are not yet supported:

* **Auxiliary connections**: Only a single connection between each switch and
  controller is available. According to the OpenFlow specifications, auxiliary
  connections could be created by the switch to improve the switch processing
  performance and exploit the parallelism of most switch implementations.

* **OpenFlow channel encryption**: The switch and controller may communicate
  through a TLS connection to provide authentication and encryption of the
  connection. However, as there is no straightforward TLS support on *ns-3*,
  the OpenFlow channel is implemented over a plain TCP connection, without
  encryption.

* **In-band control**: The OpenFlow controller manages the switches remotely
  over a separate dedicated network (out-of-band controller connection), as the
  switch port representing the switch's local networking stack and its
  management stack is not implemented.

* **Platform support**: This module is currently supported only for GNU/Linux
  platforms, as the code relies on an external library linked to the simulator
  that *must* be compiled with GCC.

|ns3| OpenFlow comparison
=========================

Note that the |ofs13| is not an extension of the available |ns3| OpenFlow
module. They share some design principles, like the use of an external software
library linked to the simulator, the virtual TCAM, and the collection of
``CsmaNetDevices`` to work as OpenFlow ports. However, this is an entirely
new code and can be used to simulate a broad number of scenarios in comparison
to the available implementation.

One difference between the |ns3| OpenFlow model and the |ofs13| is the
introduction of the OpenFlow channel, using |ns3| devices and channels to
provide the control connection between the controller and the switches. It
allows the user to collect PCAP traces for this control channel, simplifying
the analysis of OpenFlow messages. It is also possible the use of the |ns3|
``TapBridge`` module to integrate a local external OpenFlow 1.3 controller to
the simulated environment.

In respect to the controller, this module provides a more flexible interface.
Instead of dealing with the internal library structures, the user can use
simplified ``dpctl`` commands to build OpenFlow messages and send them to the
switches. However, for processing OpenFlow messages received by the controller,
the user still need to understand internal library structures and functions to
extract the desired information.

In respect to the OpenFlow protocol implementation, the |ofs13| module brings
many improved features from version 1.3 in comparison to the available |ns3|
model (version 0.8.9). Some of the most important features are:

* **Multiple tables**: Prior versions of the OpenFlow specification did expose
  to the controller the abstraction of a single table. OpenFlow 1.1 introduces
  a more flexible pipeline with multiple tables. Packets are processed through
  the pipeline, they are matched and processed in the first table, and may be
  matched and processed in other subsequent tables.

* **Groups**: The new group abstraction enables OpenFlow to represent a set of
  ports as a single entity for forwarding packets. Different types of groups
  are provided to represent different abstractions such as multicasting or
  multipathing. Each group is composed of a set group buckets, and each group
  bucket contains the set of actions to be applied before forwarding to the
  port. Groups buckets can also forward to other groups.

* **Logical ports**: Prior versions of the OpenFlow specification assumed that
  all the ports of the OpenFlow switch were physical ports. This version of the
  specification adds support for logical ports, which can represent complex
  forwarding abstractions such as tunnels. In the |ofs13| module,
  logical ports are implemented with the help of ``VirtualNetDevice`` withing
  the ``OFSwitch13Port``, where the user can configure callbacks to handle
  packets properly.

* **Extensible match support**: Prior versions of the OpenFlow specification
  used a static fixed length structure to specify ``ofp_match``, which prevents
  flexible expression of matches and prevents inclusion of new match fields.
  The ``ofp_match`` has been changed to a TLV structure, called OpenFlow
  Extensible Match (OXM), which dramatically increases flexibility.

* **IPv6 support**: Basic support for IPv6 match and header rewrite has been
  added, via the OXM match support.

* **Per-flow meters**: Per-flow meters can be attached to flow entries and can
  measure and control the rate of packets. One of the primary applications of
  per-flow meters is to rate limit packets sent to the controller.

For |ns3| OpenFlow users who want to port existing code to this new module,
please, check the :ref:`port-coding` section for detailed instructions.

|ns3| code compatibility
========================

The only required modification to the |ns3| source code for |ofs13| integration
is the inclusion of the new OpenFlow receive callback in the ``CsmaNetDevice``
and ``VirtualNetDevice``. The module brings the patch for including this
receive callback into |ns3| source code, available under
``src/ofswitch13/utils`` directory. Note the existence of an *src* patch for
the receive callbacks inclusion, and an optional *doc* patch that can be used
for including the |ofs13| when compiling Doxygen and Sphinx documentation.

The current |ofs13| stable version is 5.0.1. This version is compatible with
|ns3| version 3.31 to 3.35, and will not compile with older |ns3| versions. If
you need to use another |ns3| release, you can check the |ofs13| RELEASE_NOTES
file for previous |ofs13| releases and their |ns3| version compatibility, but
keep in mind that old releases may have known bugs and an old API. It is
strongly recommended to use the latest module version for better results.
