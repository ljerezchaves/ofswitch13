 * The TCP socket receive callback is connected to the Recv () method, which is
 * responsible for reading the correct number of bytes of a complete OpenFlow
 * message. When the OpenFlow message is completely received, it is sent to the
 * connected callback that was previously set using the SetReceiveCallback ()
 * method. On the other direction, the TCP socket send callback is connected to
 * the Send () method that forwards OpenFlow message received by the
 * SendMessage () method to the open socket, respecting the original order of
 * the messages.
