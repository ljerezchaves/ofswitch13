/**
 * \ingroup ofswitch13
 * \brief The OpenFlow 1.3 queue interface.
 *
 * An OpenFlow switch provides limited Quality-of-Service support (QoS) through
 * a simple queuing mechanism. One (or more) queues can attach to a port and be
 * used to map flow entries on it. Flow entries mapped to a specific queue will
 * be treated according to that queue's configuration. Queue configuration
 * takes place outside the OpenFlow protocol.
 *
 * This class implements the queue interface, extending the ns3::Queue<Packet>
 * class to allow compatibility with the CsmaNetDevice used by OFSwitch13Port.
 * Internally, it holds a collection of N (possibly different) queues,
 * identified by IDs ranging from 0 to N-1. The Enqueue () method uses the
 * ns3::QueueTag to identify which internal queue will hold the packet.
 * Subclasses can perform different output scheduling algorithms by
 * implementing the Dequeue (), Remove () and Peek () methods, always calling
 * the NotifyDequeue () and NotifyRemoved () methods from this base class to
 * keep consistency.
