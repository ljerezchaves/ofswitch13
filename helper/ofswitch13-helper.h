/**
 * \ingroup ofswitch13
 *
 * This is a base class that must be extended to create and configure an
 * OpenFlow 1.3 network domain composed of one or more OpenFlow switches
 * connected to single or multiple OpenFlow controllers.
 *
 * By default, the connections between switches and controllers are created
 * using a single shared out-of-band CSMA channel, with IP addresses assigned
 * using a /24 network mask. Users can modify this configuration by changing
 * the ChannelType attribute at instantiation time. Dedicated out-of-band
 * connections over CSMA or Point-to-Point channels are also available, using a
 * /30 network mask for IP allocation.
 *
 * Please note that this base helper class was designed to configure a single
 * OpenFlow network domain. All switches will be connected to all controllers
 * on the same domain. If you want to configure separated OpenFlow domains on
 * your network topology (with their individual switches and controllers) so
 * you may need to use a different instance of the derived helper class for
 * each domain. In this case, don't forget to use the SetAddressBase ()
 * method to change the IP network address of the other helper instances, in
 * order to avoid IP conflicts.
