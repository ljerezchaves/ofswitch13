OFSwitch13 release notes
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This file contains OFSwitch13 release notes (most recent releases first).


Release 5.0.1 (Dec 20, 2021)
============================

- Updating OFSwitch13Queue for compatibility with the ns-3 queue API.

- Removing DL library dependency to prevent issues with boost library.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v5.0.x and
  ns-3 version 3.31 to 3.35 (including patch). There is no backward
  compatibility with older ns-3 versions.

- Compilation was tested in Ubuntu 20.04.3.


Release 5.0.0 (Dec 19, 2021)
============================

- BE AWARE THAT this release brings incompatible API changes in respect to
  prior OFSwitch13 versions.

- Refactoring OFSwitch13Controller::Dpctl* () methods:
  * The DpctlExecute () method has no more overloaded definitions. The target
    switch (first parameter) must be the switch's datapath IP. Previous
    signature using the Ptr<const RemoteSwitch> swtch pointer was removed.
    Users can fix compilation errors by just using swtch->GetDpId () when
    invoking DpctlExecute ();
  * The DpctlSchedule () method was deprecated in favor of DpctlExecute ().
    When the switch is not connected to the controller, the DpctlExecute ()
    will automatically schedule the command for execution just after the
    handshake procedure. This is particularly useful for executing dpctl
    commands when creating the topology, before invoking Simulator::Run ().

- Creating a new OFSwitch13Device::TableDrop trace source to notify unmatched
  packets dropped by flow tables without table-miss entries. A new TabDrps
  column was also inserted in the OFSwitch13StatsCalculator output file.

- Updating OFSwitch13Queue for compatibility with the ns-3 queue API.

- Updating the ofswitch13-external-controller example with a custom topology
  configuration. This example was tested with the Ryu controller.

- Fixing incorrect Ethernet 802.3 packet header parsing.

- Fixing errors when compiling the project with gcc 9.3.0 in Ubuntu 20.04.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v5.0.x and
  ns-3 version 3.30 (including patch). There is no backward compatibility with
  older ns-3 versions.

- Compilation was tested in Debian 8, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.


Release 4.0.0 (Apr 02, 2019)
============================

- BE AWARE THAT this release brings incompatible API changes in respect to
  prior OFSwitch13 versions.

- Refactoring the OpenFlow queue:
  * The OFSwitch13Queue base class implements the queue interface, extending
    the ns3::Queue<Packet> class to allow compatibility with the CsmaNetDevice
    used by OFSwitch13Port. Internally, it holds a collection of N (possibly
    different) queues, identified by IDs ranging from 0 to N-1. The Enqueue
    method uses the ns3::QueueTag to identify which internal queue will hold
    the packet.
  * Specialized subclasses can perform different output scheduling algorithms
    by implementing the Peek, Dequeue, and Remove methods. The last two methods
    must call the NotifyDequeue and NotifyRemoved methods respectively, which
    are used to update statistics and keep consistency with the base class.
  * The OFSwitch13PriorityQueue implements the specialized priority queuing
    discipline for a collection of N priority queues, identified by IDs ranging
    from 0 to N-1 with decreasing priority (queue ID 0 has the highest
    priority). The output scheduling algorithm ensures that higher-priority
    queues are "always" served first. The OFSwitch13PriorityQueue::QueueFactory
    and OFSwitch13PriorityQueue::NumQueues attributes can be used to configure
    the type and the number of internal priority queues, respectively.
  * The OpenFlow port queue can be configured by the
    OFSwitch13Port::QueueFactory attribute at construction time.

- Overriding the OFSwitch13Helper::InstallSwitch method. When the first
  parameter is a node container, the method returns an OpenFlow device
  container. When the first parameter is a node pointer, the method returns the
  OpenFlow device pointer. For the latter, there's the optional second
  parameter of a device container that will be configured as switch ports.

- The OFSwitch13Device::FlowTableSize, GroupTableSize, and MeterTableSize
  attributes can now be adjusted at any time.

- New OFSwitch13Port::GetPortDevice, GetPortQueue and GetSwitchDevice methods.

- New OFSwitch13Device::GetDpId method as an alias for the GetDatapathId
  method.

- New OFSwitch13Device::GetDatapathStruct and OFSwitch13Port::GetPortStruct
  methods returning a pointer to the ofsoftswitch13 library structures.

- Renaming OFSwitch13Device::GetOFSwitch13Port method to GetSwitchPort.

- Renaming OFSwitch13Device attributes and trace sources to better reflect what
  they really represent: PipelineCapacity attribute was renamed to CpuCapacity,
  PipelineLoad traced value was renamed to CpuLoad, and LoadDrop trace source
  was renamed to OverloadDrop. The methods GetPipelineLoad and
  GetPipelineCapacity were also renamed to GetCpuLoad and GetCpuCapacity. These
  changes also reflects on the OFSwitch13StatsCalculator: GetEwmaPipelineLoad
  and GetAvgPipelineUsage were renamed to GetEwmaCpuLoad and GetAvgCpuUsage.

- Updating OFSwitch13Device::Get* methods for improved datapath stats. The
  GetFlowEntries, GetGroupEntries, and GetMeterEntries methods were replaced by
  GetFlowTableEntries, GetGroupTableEntries, and GetMeterTableEntries. The
  following new methods were included: GetDatapathTimeout, GetFlowTableUsage,
  GetGroupTableUsage, GetMeterTableUsage, GetNControllers, GetBufferEntries,
  GetBufferSize. The BufferUsage traced value was removed, but the method with
  the same can be used to get this value on demand.

- Improving OFSwitch13StatsCalculator with more statistics. It can now dump
  individual flow table stats. This is an optional feature (disabled by
  default), that can be enabled by the FlowTableDetails attribute.

- Renaming OFSwitch13StatsCalculator column names in first row, removing any
  special character from them.

- Increasing the maximum number of OpenFlow switch ports to 4096
  (see DP_MAX_PORTS at lib/ofsoftswitch13/udatapath/dp_ports.h)

- Increasing the maximum number of output queues on ports to 32
  (see NETDEV_MAX_QUEUES at lib/ofsoftswitch13/lib/netdev.h)

- Removing the NetBee library dependence when compiling the ofsoftswitch13
  library. The packet inspection is now performed by the packet_parse method
  at lib/ofsoftswitch13/udatapath/packet_handle_std.c.

- Improving ofsoftswitch13 library performance and fixing memory leak errors.

- Merging new commits from the CPqD ofsoftswitch13 library.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v4.0.x and
  ns-3 versions 3.28 and 3.29 (including patches). There is no backward
  compatibility with older ns-3 versions.

- Compilation was tested in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

- Introducing a new OFSwitch13Device PipelineTables attribute, allowing a
  custom number of pipeline flow tables in the switch.

- The OFSwitch13Device PipelineTables, FlowTableSize, GroupTableSize, and
  MeterTableSize attributes must now be adjusted at construction time. You can
  use the OFSwitch13Helper::SetDeviceAttribute to accomplish this task.

- Renaming OFSwitch13Device::GetFlowEntries (void) to GetSumFlowEntries (void)
  and the OFSwitch13StatsCalculator::GetEwmaFlowEntries (void) to

Release 2.0.3 (Sep 12, 2016)
============================

- Bugfix: wrong variable type on priority output queue selection.


Release 2.0.2 (Apr 11, 2016)
============================

- Including the QosController example.

  interpretation and configuration problems with further ns-3 versions. The
  OFSwitch13NetDevice class was renamed to OFSwitch13Deviceto reflect this
  change better.

- Replacing the CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow trace source, used by prior versions to
  get packets from the CsmaNetDevice port, by a new CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow
  receive callback. This new callback avoids problems with internal receive
  semantics in the way that CsmaNetDevices configure as OpenFlow ports never
  invoke the default receive callback.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v2.0.x and
  ns-3 versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1.


Release 2.0.0 (Feb 15, 2016)
============================

- First public release of the OFSwitch13 module, including source code and
  documentation.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v2.0.x and
  ns-3 versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1.
