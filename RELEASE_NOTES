+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This file contains OFSwitch13 release notes (most recent releases first).

Release 2.0.2 (April 11, 2016)
==============================

- Including the QosController example.

- The OpenFlow device is not an NetDevice child anymore. This was done to avoid
  misleading interpretation and configuration problems with further ns-3
  versions. The OFSwitch13NetDevice class was renamed to OFSwitch13Device to
  better reflect this change.

- Replacing the CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow trace source, used by prior versions to
  get packets from the CsmaNetDevice port, by a new CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow
  receive callback. This new callback avoid problems with internal receive
  semantics in the way that, for CsmaNetDevice configure as OpenFlow ports, the
  default receive callback is never invoked.

- Creating a OFSwithc13DeviceContainer for handling CsmaNetDevices. Note the
  change on InstallSwitch* methods on the OFSwitch13Helper.

- By default, 8 priority queues are created for each OFSwitch13Queue and are
  available for use.

- Updating the documentation with a better module design description (including
  new figures) and the QosController description. Minor corrections along the
  entire text.

- This code is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library, release v2.0.x and ns-3
  versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1, and 3.25 (including patches for ns-3.25).
